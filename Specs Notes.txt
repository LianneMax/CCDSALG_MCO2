Project #2 - Hash Table (Application of Hashing Functions and Collision Resolution Techniques)

Project Description:
- The program should store MANY strings as key values into a hash table data structure.
- The strings in the project will ONLY CONTAIN lowercase and uppercase letters.
- The strings should be CASE-SENSTIve.
- There are no digits, symbols, nor white spaces.
- The MAXIMUM STRING LENGTH is 15 characters (excluding the null byte).
- The strings doesn't need to be actual words (it can be aaa).

IMPORTANT THINGS TO DISCUSS WITH THE GROUP:
1. What hashing function will be used?
    - It's not limited to a simple modulus k % m
    - The objective is to find a hashing function with the smallest number of collisions.
2. What collision technique will you use?


TASK #1 (HASH TABLE: DATA STRUCTURE):
- The HASH TABLE is used to store the key valuse (string).

1. Implement the hash table as a 1D array of strings
    - The hash table size CAN BE LESS than the array size. BUT NOT MORE.
    - MAKE SURE THAT THE HASH TABLE CAN STORE A MAXIMUM OF n = 2^14 = 16384 strings
    - The HASH TABLE SIZE should be set such that it is equal to the first prime number above 1.1 * n
        EXAMPLE:
        1.
